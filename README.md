# Aeolus January 2021 SSW
Aeolus, MLS and ERA5 study of January 2021 SSW

This is the code underlying Wright et al (2021), a manuscript submitted to Weaher and Climate Dynamics which uses data from Aeolus, MLS and ERA5 to study the January 2021 SSW.


Most of the code is written in Matlab. All functions needed to produce the Figures should be included in the directory "functions/" to your Matlab path, but if I've missed any they are likely to be available from https://github.com/corwin365/MatlabFunctions. 

The code is presented as-is at time of submission, and has not been specifically tidied for upload due to time constraints - my main aim here is to produce an audit-trail for our work rather than a solid package people can use for their own work. I am very happy to help as much as I can if you're trying to decode a particular bit of code though, so get in touch if you're stuck!

Finally, for all figures manual modification to the layout, including adding contextual lines and rearranging panels into figures, was carried out in image-editing software. So: the above files will not produce final versions as seen in the paper - although usually it will be very close.
